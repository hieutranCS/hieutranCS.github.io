The project used JavaScript.<br>
Used express to write handlers for requests with different HTTPs at different URL paths.<br>
Used vue.js as a template to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.<br>
Used APIs from <a href="https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/" target="_blank">dev.twitch.tv</a> to get the data and then render the requested data to vue.js template, and display it.<br>
Since replit.com will not keep the project running constantly, I used <a href="https://uptimerobot.com " target="_blank">uptimerobot</a> to keep the project alive for testing purposes.
